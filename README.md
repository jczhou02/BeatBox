Welcome to the BeatBox, any original game where players can battle against eachother locally- chaining a potentially endless streak of related Spotify songs until theres one BeatBoxer is left standing!

BeatBox is a work in progress: developed and deployed using React, Next.js, and Vercel.
In order to use this app on your local machine, register an app on developer.spotify.com (app name can be anything). Then, once you receive a clientId and clientSecret, paste that into the files where clientId and clientSecret is needed. Then, add localhost:3000 to list of URLs on developer.spotify.com. I was able to get the development servers and Next routing working using next-auth@5.0.0-beta.20.
